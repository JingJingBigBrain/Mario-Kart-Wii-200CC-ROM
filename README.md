# Mario Kart Wii 200CC ROM
Hey guys! It's JingJing here, thanks for viewing my video and visiting this page! This project is dedicated on making a MKW ROM that run the game with 200CC tracks. That means all the tracks will be 200CC no matter which engine class you choose! This only works with single player! 

# About This Project
MKW 200CC Game Mod is a 1.5x speed mod for 150CC. I basically extracted the game file and replaced the original tracks with 200CC tracks. All you need is the game file and the cheat code.

# 200CC
Here is the link to 200CC if you want it: http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/200cc

# Cheat Code? Why?
Cheat code makes this game possible because it can allow speed mods in the course files. If you want to play normal game without 200CC, just disable the cheat code!

# IF YOU SPEND MONEY ON THIS ROM, ASK YOUR MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY!
